# Senior Architect

## Current roll

My current roll title is Senior Architect, Cloud and Product Architecture, BBC Technology and Media Operations.

I am the software architect embedded in two software development teams.
Those teams design and develop internal software and systems used across BBC News and other BBC short-form video editing areas.

My roll is to influence and nudge the product management groups and the development teams.

A few products created by the teams:

- Short-form Production and Publication team
  - Jupiter - BBC News' video MAM
    - Jupiter Classic - on-premises only video MAM - now approaching 25 years old
    - Jupiter NT - BBC News' replacement for Jupiter Classic
  - JOE - the Job Orchestration Engine used by Jupiter to manage media movement and transcode on-prem and in AWS
- Graphics and Automation team
  - BigTed - BBC News' suite of on-screen graphic drivers and automation systems
  - Screens Controller - driving the new big-screen sets seen across the BBC Regional News
  - Flipper - a new web based app controlling the bottom line of text on BBC News output, including interfacing with RedBee who can remotely enable and disable it
  - integrations automatically gathering metadata to drive captions - such as election graphics and business data

I have voluntarily joined the BBC Security Champions group, which helps me guide the product management teams who prioritise the software development work, and influence the design decisions of the software development teams.

## Previous roles

I was originally trained in broadcast Technical Operations, specialising in Video Editing and Film transmission.

Through my BBC career I have been a:

- Technical Operator recording and playing packages and programmes to air
- Studio Manager mixing live and recorded radio packages
- Dubbing Mixer of some News TV programmes
- Video Editor using Media Composer, Final Cut Pro, and Quantel sQEdit
- Software Developer writing Java, Python, Perl, SQL, and C

Following my original training I have become a domain expert in broadcast video media, and I am a local domain expert in the use of FFmpeg in a broadcast environment, with code I have created and fixed being included in FFmpeg.

## What I do day to day

- join daily stand-up meetings for each team
- join regular team design sessions, where I influence the direction of software design decisions based on the corporation-wide directions from the main architecture team, the strategic directions of projects that the development teams will be involved in, and my previous experience with broadcast media and software development
- join regular strategy meetings which influence the product direction for the development direction of the development teams
- advise on media encoding, especially ensuring the highest quality possible is attained from all media gathered through the BBC News MAMs
- write POC (Proof Of Concept) software to understand the integration between systems before integration is passed onto the software development teams

## Recently strategic meetings

- IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council) - discussing the future direction of a metadata exchange format called News in JSON, which is the metadata exchange format recommended by the DPP (Digital Publishing Partnership) in their initiative called LPX (Live Production eXchange)
- CNAP (Cloud Native Agile Production) group, lead by AWS and including BBC R&D - discussing the continued development of TAMS (Time Addressable Media Store)
